        If you're in BCIS and wondering what kind of apps you can build with the skills you've been learning, we're here to provide ideas!
      </p>

      <p>
        This site was created by a student, for students. I know what it's like to have theory heavy classes and wanting to acctually do something with what we learn. That's why I put together a few practical app ideas that don't require much advanced coding, just motivation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're a first year or finishing up your degree, taking on small projects can boost your confidence, help you land internships, and remind you why you chose BCIS in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        By starting with these small prjects, I hope to encourage students at taking that leap to scale and make larger projects the more they learn!
